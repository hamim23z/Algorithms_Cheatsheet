This is a Data Structure and Algorithm cheat sheet for myself. I try to do some sort of DSA review every day and for me the best way to
do that is by memorization. I have a notebook and every day (or at least every day), I study and write down different information regarding 
algorithms; such as sorting algorithms, master theorem, the notations, etc. 

I created this because I wanted a place to check my answer rather than actually flipping through the pages of my notepad and reading my sloppy 
handwriting to check the answers.
